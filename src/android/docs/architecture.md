# Live Fleet Tracking System - Android Mobile Application Architecture

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 System Architecture Overview
The Android mobile application is built using React Native (v0.71.x) following an offline-first architecture pattern. The application serves as a critical component in the Live Fleet Tracking System, enabling drivers to manage deliveries, track locations, and process proof of delivery documentation.

### 1.2 Design Principles
- Offline-first architecture for reliable operation without constant connectivity

## 4. Data Architecture

### 4.1 Local Storage Design
SQLite database schema:
```sql
-- Deliveries
CREATE TABLE deliveries (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    status TEXT,
    customer_info TEXT,
    timestamp INTEGER,
    sync_status TEXT
);

-- Location History
CREATE TABLE location_history (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    latitude REAL,
    longitude REAL,
    timestamp INTEGER,
    accuracy REAL,
    sync_status TEXT
);

-- Routes
CREATE TABLE routes (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    status TEXT,
    waypoints TEXT,
    timestamp INTEGER,
    sync_status TEXT
);
```

### 4.2 State Management Structure
```typescript
interface RootState {
    auth: AuthState;
    location: LocationState;
    delivery: DeliveryState;
    route: RouteState;
    offline: OfflineState;
    settings: SettingsState;
}
```

    }
    
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            debuggable true
            minifyEnabled false
        }
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
